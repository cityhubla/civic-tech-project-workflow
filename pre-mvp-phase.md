# Pre-MVP Phase

Wait, what's up with this "Pre-MVP" Phase?!  This is to keep your team's momentum going so the group doesn't get stuck in a cycle of perpetual perfectionism - you've got a strict 2 week deadline for this phase as well.

Your task:
**Publish something**

It will be ugly, it may not work, but this baby is the start of your MVP.

Done?  [Let's build this...](mvp.html)
