# Setup

You've pitched your idea, you've got your team, and your project has a clear direction - now let's get you set up for success!

Have the team come up with a working name!  This is what we'll use for your GitHub repo and Slack channel so make sure it's short, sweet, and to-the-point.  Don't worry if it's not perfect, we can always refine it later.

## Slack

Let's set up a Slack channel so the team can **communicate** with each other.

* Get everyone signed up to the Hack for LA Slack: http://hackforla.org/slack
* Create a channel with your working name (use dashes for the spaces).
* Invite everyone on the team to the channel.
* Great job, now you can all chat and discuss the project in this channel!  Remember that stuff posted to the channel will be lost eventually, so use GitHub for important things that should be documented.

## GitHub

Let's set up the GitHub repository so that we can **document** the project's progress, even for the non-technical members of your team and the non-coding aspects of your project!

* Get everyone signed up with a GitHub account.
* Flag down a hack night host:
  * Have them create a GitHub repo under the Hack For LA organization.
  * Have them add the team members to the repo as collaborators.
* Copy the link to the repo and paste it as the topic to your project's Slack channel - now everyone knows where to go for information about the project!

We have a GitHub repo, but how do we use it?

* New to GitHub?  Have team members go here - GITHUB BASICS FOR PROJECTS.
* How should the team use GitHub?
  * **For Project Management** - Create a new Issue each week to take notes on who was there, what was discussed, and what the action items are.
  * **For Code** - If possible, build out your MVP using front end only (maybe connecting to data using an API) and turn on GitHub Pages so the repo itself is your MVP.  You can get started with HTML/CSS/JS, or even Markdown.

## Done

Now that you're all set up, [let's move on to the next step](research-phase.html)...
