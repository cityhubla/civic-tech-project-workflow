# Prototype Phase

Let's keep the momentum going and build a prototype!

You can start with tools and frameworks that are free and easy to use for the members of the group:
* Photoshop
* Sketch
* Marvel
* Invision
* Jekyll
* HTML/CSS, Bootstrap
* Pen and Paper

This should be **quick** - don't spend more than 2 weeks on the prototype!

Use this time to prioritize features for your MVP so that it can launch within 2-3 months.  If you have a hard time agreeing on features, consider using a Value-Effort Matrix to reach a consensus on features that are high value/low effort.

Did you build your prototype in code?
