# Discovery Phase

You are in the Discovery Phase!  You've got a general idea of what you're interested in and maybe you've got a lot of questions.  It's time to turn that into a project idea!

Here are some questions to help you out:

* What is everyone on the team interested in?
* What do they know?
* What do they not know?
* Who do you want to help?
* What are the problems being faced?
* How could you address the problems?
* What would an MVP look like?
* How feasible is the MVP?

Do some digging!  Here are some websites you can look at:
