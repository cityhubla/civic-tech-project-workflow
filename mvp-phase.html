# MVP Phase

You have arrived at the almighty MVP Phase.  Give yourselves a **HARD 2-3 month deadline**.  Tell your friendly local Hack Night Host and they will schedule a date for the team to present at Hack Night.

You've already figured out the features, the technology, the tools... get developing!

For you non-coders, you can spend your time preparing the presentation.

Once you've hit your deadline and launched your MVP (woohoo!), take a breather and pat yourselves on the back.  You deserve it!  Get the team together and hold a retrospective session:

* Was the Project section of the Planning Canvas satisfied?
* What went well?
* What didnâ€™t go so well?
* What has the team learned?
* What does the team still have questions about?

Document your retrospective in the repo, and then [let's move on](testing-phase.html).
