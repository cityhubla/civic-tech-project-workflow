# Research Phase

There's a lot that goes into a successful project, even the ones that seem simple.  Let's make sure you're well equipped for success by refining the project goals and strategy.  As a team, fill out all the sections of the [Civic Tech Canvas](https://www.open-austin.org/civic-tech-canvas/) from Open Austin.  You don't need to spend too long on this because you'll visit it again later.  Save the responses in the repo so you can document the team's progress.

* The Problem
  * Problem Statement
    * What is the issue we're trying to solve and what are the primary challenges?
* The Solution
  * Users & Those Impacted
    * Who will use this app/project/tool?
    * Create personas or user stories for your target audience.
    * Who else will this project affect and how?
    * Who is the primary beneficiary?
    * How can you find users for feedback?
  * Project
    * What will we create for the user, and how will this address the problem?
    * What are the goals or metrics for success in the short term and long term?
  * Features & Benefits
    * What are the core features needed for this app/project/tool to be successful?
    * How does each feature address a need or goal?
* The Logistics
  * Key Activities
    * What tasks are required to implement the core features?
    * How will this app/project/tol get to its intended audience, and how will we get them to use it?
    * How will we maintain momentum for development, and how will we keep the end product fresh?
  * Key Resources
    * What resources are needed to complete the Key Activities listed (datasets, subject matter experts, etc.)?
    * What will you need help with?
    * What technologies are best suited for the requirements?
  * Partners
    * Who can help us create this project?
    * What existing organizations can help us obtain the Key Resources?
    * What existing community groups have an interest in the success of this project?

Do some research into existing solutions.
* Has anyone already tried to tackle this problem?
* Have they been successful or not, and why?
* Look at what has been done by non-profits, government, other Code for America brigades, and projects funded by various foundations and fellowship programs.

Once you've identified Users and Partners, don't be afraid to talk to them **in person** to learn about their needs!

At this point, you should have a good idea the resources and tasks required to move forward to [Design and Build the Prototype](prototype-phase.html).
